            <div class="tooltip">Kandinsky was one of the first artists to explore abstraction.  He used the name Improvisation as a reference to a musical composition. He is associating painting with music, as if he were composing with form and colors. &#10;<br>Wassily Kandinsky&#10;<br>Watercolor and pencil on paper. 14 x 17 5/8" (35.6 x 44.8 cm)</div>

            <div class="tooltip">The factory chimneys jut into the sky in striking tones of red. This bright piece verges on Fauvist in how the original tones that the artist would have seen are almost entirely replaced with his contemporary use of yellow, purple and blue. There is enough of a connection to reality with greens on the tips of the hills and blue across the sky to help us immediately recognise the compositional elements, but then the rest diverges into the world of Kandinsky where traditional thinking is thrown away and a more expressive style is used.&#10;<br>Wassily Kandinsky&#10;<br>Oil on canvas. 66.2 x 82 cm (26 x 32 1/4 inches)</div>

            <div class="tooltip">In Landscape with Two Poplars, Kandinsky presents a scene that has not been completely abstracted, yet neither are the forms entirely representational of nature. Utilizing intense hues of red, green, yellow and blue, Kandinsky has contorted the houses, trees and grounds into unmodulated patches of nonmimetic color and irregularly shaped triangular forms. As if taken from a dream, the setting is distorted into oddly bending roofs and off-kilter treetops that blend into an indeterminate landscape of jumbled red, yellow and blue blotches. Kandinsky creates an implied sense of perspective through the diagonal pathways that lead us into the center of the painting and by the cool, blue rise of the foothills beyond that appear to recede into the distance. Though we may have difficulty recognizing this scene as one from nature (where is that second poplar?), the tone is not off-putting; rather, the bold, bright colors elicit a cheerful, almost harmonious sensation.&#10;<br>Wassily Kandinsky&#10;<br>Oil on canvas, 31 x 39"</div>

            <div class="tooltip">Moscow for Kandinsky is a big confusion, so everything in his paintings is intertwined, confused, incomprehensible. But if you look closely, you can see the famous pavement in Red Square. You can see little men, and even a building that looks like the Bolshoi Theater.&#10;<br>Wassily Kandinsky&#10;<br>Oil on canvas, 20.3 × 19.5" (51.5 × 49.5 cm)</div>
